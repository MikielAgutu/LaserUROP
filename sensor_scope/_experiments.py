    """Function to carry out a sequence of measurements as per iter_list,
    take an image at each position, post-process it and return a final result.

    :param exp_obj: The experiment object.

    :param positions_dict: A dictionary of lists of 2-tuples to indicate all
    positions where images should be taken:
        {'x': [(n_x1, step_x1), ...], 'y': [(n_y1, step_y1), ...], 'z': ...],
    where each key indicates the axis to move, 'n' is the number of times
    to step (resulting in n+1 images) and 'step' is the number of microsteps
    between each subsequent image. So {'x': [(3, 100)]} would move only the
    x-axis of the microscope, taking 4 images at x=-150, x=-50, x=50,
    x=150 microsteps relative to the initial position. Note that:
    - Not all keys need to be specified.
    - All lists must be the same length.
    - All measurements will be taken symmetrically about the initial position.

    The position of each tuple in the list is important. If we have
    {'x': [(1, 100), (0, 100)],
     'y': [(2,  50), (3,  40)]},
    then tuples of the same index from each list will be combined into an
    array. This means that for the 0th index of the list, for x we have the
    positions [-50, 50] and [0] and for y [-50, 0, 50] and [-60, -20, 20, 60]
    respectively. [-50, 50] and [-50, 0, 50] will be combined to get the
    resulting array of [[-50, -50], [-50, 0], [-50, 50], [50, -50], [50, 0],
    [50, 50]], and the latter two to get [[0, -60], [0, -20], [0, 20],
    [0, 60]]. These are all the positions the stage will move to (the format
    here is [x, y]), iterating through each array in the order given.

    If you prefer to take images once for all the 'x' and, separately, once
    for all the 'y', run this function twice, once for 'x', once for 'y'.

    :param func_list: The post-processing curried function list, created using
    the baker function in the _experiments.py module.

    :param order_gen: A generator object that determines the order to visit
    each position. Takes arguments (x_positions_array, y_positions_arry,
    z_positions_array, intial_position_vector).

    :param save_mode: How to save at the end of each iteration.
    - 'save_each': Every single measurement is saved: {'x': [(3, 100)]}
      would result in 4 post-processed results being saved, which is useful if
      the post-processed results are image arrays.
    - 'save_final': Every single measurement is made before the entire set of
      results, as an array, is saved along with their positions, in the
      format [[x-column], [y-column], [z-column], [measurements-column]]. This
      is good for the post-processed results that are single numerical value.
    - 'save_subset': Each array is measured before being saved (for example, in
      the description of iter_dict, there are two arrays being iterated
      through).
    - None: Data is not saved at all, but is returned. Might be useful if
      this is intermediate step.

    :param end_func: A curried function, which is executed on the array of
    final results. This can be useful to move to a position where the final
    measurement is maximised. Note: if save_mode is 'save_each', the results
    array will be empty so end_func must be None.

    :param valid_keys: A tuple of strings containing all keys that are valid
    ways to move. if rotational degrees of freedom are introduced, this can
    include theta, etc.

    :param number: The number of measurements to average over at each position.

    :param delay: The time delay between each individual measurement taken
    at a specific position."""
